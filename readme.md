# Exploring [Modified] TOPSIS solution method

Tags: web scraping, topsis, madm, decision making

## Summary

In this small exploration I wanted to get hands-on experience of using [Modified] TOPSIS method to support decision making  
This project consists of 2 parts: 1st part is getting data to experiment on using web scraping and 2nd part is brief EDA and applying TOPSIS

## Short description of TOPSIS

[TOPSIS (the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277266222100014X#:~:text=2.2.-,The%20TOPSIS%20method,distances%20from%20the%20ideal%20solutions.) and its variant - Modified TOPSIS - are similar methods. They belong to class of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making) methods.  
They are simple and often used to make decisions in situations where multiple attributes have to be considered and the best variant has to be chosen.  
Main underlying concept of both of these methods is that the best real option has to be the closest to positive ideal option and the farthest from negative ideal option. By "ideal" these methods mean options which incorporate all the best (or worst) options of attributes.
